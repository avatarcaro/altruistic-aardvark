        I love pens. <br> I'm left-handed, so I am always looking for pens that don't smear when I write. <br> I also write <i>really</i> small, so I like finding pens that are 0.5mm or less to use most of the time. <br>
    I've found a few pens that I have used for years now: 
    the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-Retractable-Micro-Point-Black/dp/B0015ZZ7P2/">Uni-Ball 207 series</a>, 
    micro point, <br> and the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Roller-31277/dp/B0017TMMLS/">Pilot G2 Pens</a>
     with an ultra fine point. <br> I appreciate good pens so much that I carry them with me almost everywhere so I don't have to use anything else. <br>I might take pens a little too seriously, but I'm really excited that I found ones I love.

If I ever get a chance to go to a store with a candle aisle, <br>there's a good chance I won't leave that aisle for at least an hour. <br>
I love candles; I have especially come to love <a href="https://homesick.com/collections/state-candles/products/idaho-candle">Homesick Candles</a> that are designed to smell like specific places. <br>
Homesick Candles has a candle scent for every state, and I just want to buy myself one of their candles to reminisce about every place I've lived. <br> Candles are really good at bringing up memories, and I love how smells have that kind of power.
